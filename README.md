# Layout Responsive Testing Study using Galen Framework

This repo could be used to understand how the Galen Framework could be used to test a responsive website based on http://mindengine.net/post/2014-01-07-layout-testing-for-responsive-websites-with-selenium.-doing-it-properly and http://galenframework.com/docs/tutorial-first-project/.

This repo contains tests. The goal is to run automated tests and have a final report. 

All documentation about Galen can be found on http://galenframework.com

### Running Tests
To run the tests use this command.

````
galen test test-example.test --htmlreport .
```

Galen generates a lot of stuff but just open the "report.html" file to access to the final report result.
